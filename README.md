Blaze Team Repository

Welcome!

Some rules regarding the Git:

1. Create a brach with your Discord name, and do not work on the master branch.
2. After commiting the change, open a pull request so we can see the changes you made.
3. DO NOT - use the master branch, it is for the finished product and not for the small changes people make.
4. Have fun :)
